# ISHARAY
Project "ISHARAY" is our step toward making communication more inclusive and accessible for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in Bangladesh. We built a system that can recognize Bangla sign language in real time using machine learning and computer vision, and also play sign videos based on user-typed Bangla text.
